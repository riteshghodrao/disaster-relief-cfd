# disaster-relief-cfd
The idea is to predict natural disasters through twitter or similar social media activity and broadcast the details of potential damage, precautions and rescue points to citizens through mobile app(android for now) and web app. 
There will be Web Application as well specifically for people who are willing to provide help. This will show the message or location of those who are asking for help, so if possible they can reach out directly. There would also be additional details, like contributing NGOs, or fundraising etc available so anyone can help in any possible way.

The Android Application will also display the locations of nearest rescue camps on map to users in such case. The users can also broadcast their location and message through the app. The location will be marked on the map so rescuers can reach out to the user. Further updates and important contacts will also be sent to the users who are trapped.
